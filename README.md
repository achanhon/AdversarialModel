**This code use third party: see the downloaded file!**

From theoretic point of view, this code should be fully reproducible.

Yet, it is probably not cross plateform - it has probably hidden dependencies - and it may varies depending on software version, nvidia driver and nvidia hardware.

If you do not manadge to reproduce the experiment, feel free to ask me about more detail.

I will try to answer **all** requests depending on my available time.

## DESCRIPTION

This code highlights the possibility to produce an invisible data poisoning: strongly modify the model (resulting from a fair learning) by adding unperceptible perturbation to training samples.
